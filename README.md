# Notifications Microservice | Clean Architecture and SOLID

![banner](banner.png)

> Project carried out at the  Rocketseat's `Ignite Lab |Node.js`, in this event we built a small notifications microservice using the
> best practices for developing scalable and maintainable backend applications, applying various concepts related to `Clean Architecture`,
> like `SOLID principles`, `Design Patterns` and `Domain-Driven Design` for example. We also create `unit and automated tests` to test different
> `use cases` of the application. And at the end of the event, we integrated our application with `Apache Kafka` (an open-source platform for broadcasting
> of data in a continuous stream. That is, it is a high-performance, real-time messaging system).
